# EVALUATION-OF-RADAR-RANGE-USING-PYTHON-

__Aim__:

To calculate the maximum range of a radar system using the Radar Range Equation and verify the results 
through Python programming.

__Theory__:

The Radar Range Equation is a fundamental formula used in radar system design to determine the maximum 
range at which a radar can detect a target. It is given by:

__Procedure__:

1. Set Up the Python Environment: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can use 
Anaconda for managing Python packages and environments, or any other Python IDE of your choice. 
2. Import Necessary Libraries: Import the math library in Python. 
3. Define the Radar Range Equation Function: Create a function to calculate the maximum range using 
the Radar Range Equation. 
4. Input Parameters for the Radar System: Define the input parameters such as transmitted power, 
transmitter gain, receiver gain, radar frequency, radar cross section, and minimum detectable power. 
5. Calculate the Maximum Range: Use the function to calculate the maximum range of the radar. 
6. Execute the Program: Run the Python script to calculate and display the maximum range of the radar.
   __Output__:
